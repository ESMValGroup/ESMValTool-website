  A community diagnostics and performance metrics
  tool for the evaluation of Earth system models
  (ESMs) has been developed that allows for routine
  comparison of single or multiple models, either
  against predecessor versions or against
  observations. The priority of the effort so far has
  been to target specific scientific themes focusing
  on selected essential climate variables (ECVs), a
  range of known systematic biases common to ESMs,
  such as coupled tropical climate variability,
  monsoons, Southern Ocean processes, continental dry
  biases, and soil hydrology-climate interactions, as
  well as atmospheric CO2 budgets, tropospheric and
  stratospheric ozone, and tropospheric aerosols. The
  tool is being developed in such a way that
  additional analyses can easily be added. A set of
  standard namelists for each scientific topic
  reproduces specific sets of diagnostics or
  performance metrics that have demonstrated their
  importance in ESM evaluation in the peer-reviewed
  literature. The Earth System Model Evaluation Tool
  (ESMValTool) is a community effort open to both
  users and developers encouraging open exchange of
  diagnostic source code and evaluation results from
  the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)
  ensemble. This will facilitate and improve ESM
  evaluation beyond the state-of-the-art and aims at
  supporting such activities within CMIP and at
  individual modelling centres. Ultimately, we
  envisage running the ESMValTool alongside the Earth
  System Grid Federation (ESGF) as part of a more
  routine evaluation of CMIP model simulations while
  utilizing observations available in standard
  formats (obs4MIPs) or provided by the user.

  The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
  (CMIP) is now moving into its sixth phase and aims
  at a more routine evaluation of the models as soon
  as the model output is published to the Earth
  System Grid Federation (ESGF). To meet this goal
  the Earth System Model Evaluation Tool
  (ESMValTool), a community diagnostics and
  performance metrics tool for the systematic
  evaluation of Earth system models (ESMs) in CMIP,
  has been developed and a first version (1.0)
  released as open source software in 2015. Here, an
  enhanced version of the ESMValTool is presented
  that exploits a subset of Essential Climate
  Variables (ECVs) from the European Space Agency's
  Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) Phase 2 and
  this version is used to demonstrate the value of
  the data for model evaluation. This subset includes
  consistent, long-term time series of ECVs obtained
  from harmonized, reprocessed products from
  different satellite instruments for sea surface
  temperature, sea ice, cloud, soil moisture, land
  cover, aerosol, ozone, and greenhouse gases. The
  ESA CCI data allow extending the calculation of
  performance metrics as summary statistics for some
  variables and add an important alternative data set
  in other cases where observations are already
  available. The provision of uncertainty estimates
  on a per grid basis for the ESA CCI data sets is
  used in a new extended version of the Taylor
  diagram and provides important additional
  information for a more objective evaluation of the
  models. In our analysis we place a specific focus
  on the comparability of model and satellite data
  both in time and space. The ESA CCI data are well
  suited for an evaluation of results from global
  climate models across ESM compartments as well as
  an analysis of long-term trends, variability and
  change in the context of a changing climate. The
  enhanced version of the ESMValTool is released as
  open source software and ready to support routine
  model evaluation in CMIP6 and at individual
  modeling centers.

  The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
  (CMIP) has successfully provided the climate
  community with a rich collection of simulation
  output from Earth system models (ESMs) that can be
  used to understand past climate changes and make
  projections and uncertainty estimates of the
  future. Confidence in ESMs can be gained because
  the models are based on physical principles and
  reproduce many important aspects of observed
  climate. Scientifically more research is required
  to identify the processes that are most responsible
  for systematic biases and the magnitude and
  uncertainty of future projections so that more
  relevant performance tests can be developed. At the
  same time, there are many aspects of ESM evaluation
  that are well-established and considered an
  essential part of systematic evaluation but are
  currently implemented ad hoc with little community
  coordination. Given the diversity and complexity of
  ESM model analysis, we argue that the CMIP
  community has reached a critical juncture at which
  many baseline aspects of model evaluation need to
  be performed much more efficiently to enable a
  systematic, open and rapid performance assessment
  of the large and diverse number of models that will
  participate in current and future phases of CMIP.
  Accomplishing this could also free up valuable
  resources as many scientists are frequently
  "re-inventing the wheel" by re-writing analysis
  routines for well-established analysis methods. A
  more systematic approach for the community would be
  to develop evaluation tools that are well suited
  for routine use and provide a wide range of
  diagnostics and performance metrics that
  comprehensively characterize model behaviour as
  soon as the output is published to the Earth System
  Grid Federation (ESGF). The CMIP infrastructure
  enforces data standards and conventions for model
  output accessible via ESGF, additionally publishing
  observations (obs4MIPs) and reanalyses (ana4MIPs)
  for Model Intercomparison Projects using the same
  data structure and organization. This largely
  facilitates routine evaluation of the models, but
  to be able to process the data automatically
  alongside the ESGF, the infrastructure needs to be
  extended with processing capabilities at the ESGF
  data nodes where the evaluation tools can be
  executed on a routine basis. Efforts are already
  underway to develop community-based evaluation
  tools, and we encourage experts to provide
  additional diagnostic codes that would enhance this
  capability for CMIP. At the same time, we encourage
  the community to contribute observations for model
  evaluation to the obs4MIPs archive. The intention
  is to produce through ESGF a widely accepted
  quasi-operational evaluation framework for climate
  models that would routinely execute a series of
  standardized evaluation tasks. Over time, as the
  capability matures, we expect to produce an
  increasingly systematic characterization of models,
  which, compared with early phases of CMIP, will
  more quickly and openly identify the strengths and
  weaknesses of the simulations. This will also
  expose whether long-standing model errors remain
  evident in newer models and will assist modelling
  groups in improving their models. This framework
  will be designed to readily incorporate updates,
  including new observations and additional
  diagnostics and metrics as they become available
  from the research community.
