  The Earth System Model Evaluation Tool
  (ESMValTool) is a community diagnostics and
  performance metrics tool designed to improve
  comprehensive and routine evaluation of Earth
  System Models (ESMs) participating in the Coupled
  Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). It has
  undergone rapid development since the first release
  in 2016 and is now a well-tested tool that provides
  end-to-end provenance tracking to ensure
  reproducibility. It consists of (1) an easy-to-install,
  well documented Python package providing the core
  functionalities (ESMValCore) that performs common
  pre-processing operations and (2) a diagnostic part
  that includes tailored diagnostics and performance
  metrics for specific scientific applications. Here
  we describe large-scale diagnostics of the second
  major release of the tool that supports the
  evaluation of ESMs participating in CMIP Phase 6
  (CMIP6). ESMValTool v2.0 includes a large
  collection of diagnostics and performance metrics
  for atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial variables
  for the mean state, trends, and variability.
  ESMValTool v2.0 also successfully reproduces
  figures from the evaluation and projections
  chapters of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
  Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and
  incorporates updates from targeted analysis
  packages, such as the NCAR Climate Variability
  Diagnostics Package for the evaluation of modes of
  variability the Thermodynamic Diagnostic Tool
  (TheDiaTo) to evaluate the energetics of the
  climate system, as well as parts of AutoAssess that
  contains a mix of top-down performance metrics. The
  tool has been fully integrated into the Earth
  System Grid Federation (ESGF) infrastructure at the
  Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum (DKRZ) to provide
  evaluation results from CMIP6 model simulations
  shortly after the output is published to the CMIP
  archive. A result browser has been implemented that
  enables advanced monitoring of the evaluation
  results by a broad user community at much faster
  timescales than what was possible in CMIP5.

  The Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool), a community
  diagnostics and performance metrics tool for evaluation and analysis
  of Earth system models (ESMs) is designed to facilitate a more
  comprehensive and rapid comparison of single or multiple models
  participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP).
  The ESM results can be compared against observations or reanalysis
  data as well as against other models including predecessor versions
  of the same model. The updated and extended version 2.0 of the
  ESMValTool includes several new analysis scripts such as large-scale
  diagnostics for evaluation of ESMs as well as diagnostics for extreme
  events, regional model and impact evaluation. In this paper, the newly
  implemented climate metrics such as effective climate sensitivity (ECS)
  and transient climate response (TCR) as well as emergent constraints
  for various climate-relevant feedbacks and diagnostics for future
  projections from ESMs are described and illustrated with examples
  using results from the well-established model ensemble CMIP5. The
  emergent constraints implemented include constraints on ECS,
  snow-albedo effect, climate-carbon cycle feedback, hydrologic cycle
  intensification, future Indian summer monsoon precipitation, and year
  of disappearance of summer Arctic sea ice. The diagnostics included
  in ESMValTool v2.0 to analyze future climate projections from ESMs
  further include analysis scripts to reproduce selected figures of
  chapter 12 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC)
  Fifth Assessment report (AR5) and various multi-model statistics.

  This paper describes the second major release of the Earth System Model
  Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool), a community diagnostic and performance
  metrics tool for the evaluation of Earth system models (ESMs) participating
  in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). Compared to version
  1.0, released in 2016, ESMValTool version 2.0 (v2.0) features a brand new
  design, with an improved interface and a revised preprocessor. It also
  features a significantly enhanced diagnostic part that is described in
  three companion papers. The new version of ESMValTool has been specifically
  developed to target the increased data volume of CMIP Phase 6 (CMIP6) and the
  related challenges posed by the analysis and the evaluation of output from
  multiple high-resolution or complex ESMs. The new version takes advantage of
  state-of-the-art computational libraries and methods to deploy an efficient
  and user-friendly data processing. Common operations on the input data (such
  as regridding or computation of multi-model statistics) are centralized in a
  highly optimized preprocessor, which allows applying a series of preprocessing
  functions before diagnostics scripts are applied for in-depth scientific analysis
  of the model output. Performance tests conducted on a set of standard diagnostics
  show that the new version is faster than its predecessor by about a factor of 3.
  The performance can be further improved, up to a factor of more than 30, when
  the newly introduced task-based parallelization options are used, which enable
  the efficient exploitation of much larger computing infrastructures. ESMValTool
  v2.0 also includes a revised and simplified installation procedure, the setting
  of user-configurable options based on modern language formats, and high code
  quality standards following the best practices for software development.

  This paper complements a series of now four publications that
  document the release of the Earth System Model Evaluation Tool
  (ESMValTool) v2.0. It describes new diagnostics on the hydrological
  cycle, extreme events, impact assessment, regional evaluations, and
  ensemble member selection. The diagnostics are developed by a large
  community of scientists aiming to facilitate the evaluation and
  comparison of Earth system models (ESMs) which are participating in the
  Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). The second release of this
  tool aims to support the evaluation of ESMs participating in CMIP
  Phase 6 (CMIP6). Furthermore, datasets from other models and observations
  can be analysed. The diagnostics for the hydrological cycle include several
  precipitation and drought indices, as well as hydroclimatic intensity and
  indices from the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI).
  The latter are also used for identification of extreme events, for impact
  assessment, and to project and characterize the risks and impacts of
  climate change for natural and socio-economic systems. Further impact
  assessment diagnostics are included to compute daily temperature ranges
  and capacity factors for wind and solar energy generation. Regional scales
  can be analysed with new diagnostics implemented for selected regions and
  stochastic downscaling. ESMValTool v2.0 also includes diagnostics to analyse
  large multi-model ensembles including grouping and selecting ensemble members
  by user-specified criteria. Here, we present examples for their capabilities
  based on the well-established CMIP Phase 5 (CMIP5) dataset.

  A community diagnostics and performance metrics
  tool for the evaluation of Earth system models
  (ESMs) has been developed that allows for routine
  comparison of single or multiple models, either
  against predecessor versions or against
  observations. The priority of the effort so far has
  been to target specific scientific themes focusing
  on selected essential climate variables (ECVs), a
  range of known systematic biases common to ESMs,
  such as coupled tropical climate variability,
  monsoons, Southern Ocean processes, continental dry
  biases, and soil hydrology-climate interactions, as
  well as atmospheric CO2 budgets, tropospheric and
  stratospheric ozone, and tropospheric aerosols. The
  tool is being developed in such a way that
  additional analyses can easily be added. A set of
  standard namelists for each scientific topic
  reproduces specific sets of diagnostics or
  performance metrics that have demonstrated their
  importance in ESM evaluation in the peer-reviewed
  literature. The Earth System Model Evaluation Tool
  (ESMValTool) is a community effort open to both
  users and developers encouraging open exchange of
  diagnostic source code and evaluation results from
  the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)
  ensemble. This will facilitate and improve ESM
  evaluation beyond the state-of-the-art and aims at
  supporting such activities within CMIP and at
  individual modelling centres. Ultimately, we
  envisage running the ESMValTool alongside the Earth
  System Grid Federation (ESGF) as part of a more
  routine evaluation of CMIP model simulations while
  utilizing observations available in standard
  formats (obs4MIPs) or provided by the user.

  The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
  (CMIP) is now moving into its sixth phase and aims
  at a more routine evaluation of the models as soon
  as the model output is published to the Earth
  System Grid Federation (ESGF). To meet this goal
  the Earth System Model Evaluation Tool
  (ESMValTool), a community diagnostics and
  performance metrics tool for the systematic
  evaluation of Earth system models (ESMs) in CMIP,
  has been developed and a first version (1.0)
  released as open source software in 2015. Here, an
  enhanced version of the ESMValTool is presented
  that exploits a subset of Essential Climate
  Variables (ECVs) from the European Space Agency's
  Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) Phase 2 and
  this version is used to demonstrate the value of
  the data for model evaluation. This subset includes
  consistent, long-term time series of ECVs obtained
  from harmonized, reprocessed products from
  different satellite instruments for sea surface
  temperature, sea ice, cloud, soil moisture, land
  cover, aerosol, ozone, and greenhouse gases. The
  ESA CCI data allow extending the calculation of
  performance metrics as summary statistics for some
  variables and add an important alternative data set
  in other cases where observations are already
  available. The provision of uncertainty estimates
  on a per grid basis for the ESA CCI data sets is
  used in a new extended version of the Taylor
  diagram and provides important additional
  information for a more objective evaluation of the
  models. In our analysis we place a specific focus
  on the comparability of model and satellite data
  both in time and space. The ESA CCI data are well
  suited for an evaluation of results from global
  climate models across ESM compartments as well as
  an analysis of long-term trends, variability and
  change in the context of a changing climate. The
  enhanced version of the ESMValTool is released as
  open source software and ready to support routine
  model evaluation in CMIP6 and at individual
  modeling centers.

  The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
  (CMIP) has successfully provided the climate
  community with a rich collection of simulation
  output from Earth system models (ESMs) that can be
  used to understand past climate changes and make
  projections and uncertainty estimates of the
  future. Confidence in ESMs can be gained because
  the models are based on physical principles and
  reproduce many important aspects of observed
  climate. Scientifically more research is required
  to identify the processes that are most responsible
  for systematic biases and the magnitude and
  uncertainty of future projections so that more
  relevant performance tests can be developed. At the
  same time, there are many aspects of ESM evaluation
  that are well-established and considered an
  essential part of systematic evaluation but are
  currently implemented ad hoc with little community
  coordination. Given the diversity and complexity of
  ESM model analysis, we argue that the CMIP
  community has reached a critical juncture at which
  many baseline aspects of model evaluation need to
  be performed much more efficiently to enable a
  systematic, open and rapid performance assessment
  of the large and diverse number of models that will
  participate in current and future phases of CMIP.
  Accomplishing this could also free up valuable
  resources as many scientists are frequently
  "re-inventing the wheel" by re-writing analysis
  routines for well-established analysis methods. A
  more systematic approach for the community would be
  to develop evaluation tools that are well suited
  for routine use and provide a wide range of
  diagnostics and performance metrics that
  comprehensively characterize model behaviour as
  soon as the output is published to the Earth System
  Grid Federation (ESGF). The CMIP infrastructure
  enforces data standards and conventions for model
  output accessible via ESGF, additionally publishing
  observations (obs4MIPs) and reanalyses (ana4MIPs)
  for Model Intercomparison Projects using the same
  data structure and organization. This largely
  facilitates routine evaluation of the models, but
  to be able to process the data automatically
  alongside the ESGF, the infrastructure needs to be
  extended with processing capabilities at the ESGF
  data nodes where the evaluation tools can be
  executed on a routine basis. Efforts are already
  underway to develop community-based evaluation
  tools, and we encourage experts to provide
  additional diagnostic codes that would enhance this
  capability for CMIP. At the same time, we encourage
  the community to contribute observations for model
  evaluation to the obs4MIPs archive. The intention
  is to produce through ESGF a widely accepted
  quasi-operational evaluation framework for climate
  models that would routinely execute a series of
  standardized evaluation tasks. Over time, as the
  capability matures, we expect to produce an
  increasingly systematic characterization of models,
  which, compared with early phases of CMIP, will
  more quickly and openly identify the strengths and
  weaknesses of the simulations. This will also
  expose whether long-standing model errors remain
  evident in newer models and will assist modelling
  groups in improving their models. This framework
  will be designed to readily incorporate updates,
  including new observations and additional
  diagnostics and metrics as they become available
  from the research community.
