# Presentations

Past Presentations using or introducing ESMValTool are listed in the [Community Repository](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/Community?tab=readme-ov-file#presentations) on GitHub. Some of these include links to the pdfs. If you would like to use those slides for your own presentation and would therefore require the .pptx files, feel free to contact the presenter given in the list.

# Community Tutorials

Beside the [Official ESMValTool Tutorial](https://tutorial.esmvaltool.org/), many tutorials made by the community exist, often tailored for specific projects or topics. A list of past training events can be found [here](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/Community/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#training-events). Have you held a tutorial and would like to share the files or videos on the website? Let us know.

While these are tailored for ACCESS users, they are still very informative. |
