## Governance

The [ESMValTool governance structure is described here](/assets/pdf/ESMValTool_Governance.pdf). The following partners have signed a consortium agreement (in alphabetical order):

* Australian National University, ACCESS-NRI, Australia (in the process of becoming a new member)
* Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), Spain
* Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR), Institut für Physik der Atmosphäre, Germany (Co-PI)
* Met Office, United Kingdom (Co-PI)
* Netherlands eScience Center (NLeSC), The Netherlands
* Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI), Sweden

## Coordination teams

The following three teams help to coordinate the development and maintenance:

* [Scientific Lead Development Team](https://github.com/orgs/ESMValGroup/teams/scientific-lead-development-team) defines and maintains scientific standards, prioritizes future development needs, oversees the scientific documentation
* [Technical Lead Development Team](https://github.com/orgs/ESMValGroup/teams/technical-lead-development-team) oversees and develops technical developments, infrastructure (including releases) and technical documentation
* [User Engagement Team](https://github.com/orgs/ESMValGroup/teams/userengagementteam) interacts with the users in collaboration with the technical and scientific lead development teams and coordinates development and maintenance of the ESMValTool tutorial
