The ESMValTool is available at GitHub: [https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool)

The ESMValTool is also available as a [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) package. We recommend using [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/) as a package manager for your conda environments instead of [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/). Once you have installed the mamba package manager, you can install the entire ESMValTool package by running:

```
mamba create --name esmvaltool esmvaltool
```

Detailed installation instructions can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html).
