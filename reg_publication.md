When you publish a scientific article or give a presentation at a scientific
conference showing results that were produced with the ESMValTool, we would
like to encourage you to register your publication. This helps us keeping
track of the usage of the ESMValTool and allows our funding agencies to
monitor its application. Thank you!

Please register your publication by sending an email to \
