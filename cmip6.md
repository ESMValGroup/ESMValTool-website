## ESMValTool contribution to CMIP6

We argue that the CMIP community has reached a critical juncture at which
many baseline aspects of model evaluation need to be performed much more
efficiently to enable a systematic and rapid performance assessment of the
large number of models participating in CMIP, and we announce our intention
to implement such an evaluation system for CMIP6 (Eyring et al., 2016).
The ESMValTool will be used to produce a broad characterization of CMIP
DECK and historical simulations as soon as new CMIP6 model experiments are
published to the ESGF.

Within the German CMIP6 project, an ESMValTool result website has been created
(see [https://cmip-esmvaltool.dkrz.de](https://cmip-esmvaltool.dkrz.de)). This
website currently shows results produced with the ESMValTool for CMIP5 simulations.
This website will be updated with CMIP6 results as soon as the model output is
submitted to the ESGF. The result browser includes a search function that allows
you to sort the results by (a) ESMValTool recipe, (b) Projects, (c) CMIP6 Realms,
(d) Themes, (e) Domain, (f) Plot Type, (g) Statistics, (h) References, (i) Variables,
(j) Models, and (k) Results. Each figure includes a figure caption that is displayed
alongside with the figure, and also includes metadata that are displayed when you
click on the figure. These metadata include the ESMValTool configuration used to
calculate and plot the figure, Program's output, Notes, and Results. This is possible
via the newly introduced tags. It would be great if you could check this for the
recipes you have developed and let us know in case you spot anything that is wrong.

The CMIP6 evaluation results produced with the ESMValTool are made publically
available on this website without password restriction. Initially this website
shows CMIP5 results that are already published. Newly produced results for CMIP6
will initially be water-marked and will only be made available without water-mark once
quality control has happened and possible papers have been written. This strategy has
been supported, encouraged, and approved by the WCRP Working Group of Coupled Modelling
(WGCM). Therefore, all CMIP6 results presented on this website are strictly confidential
as long as they are water-marked and should not be used in publications. We encourage
all CMIP6 modelling groups to quality control the results for their models. Please follow
the CMIP6 Terms of Use.

We emphasize that this newly established evaluation workflow of the ESMs cannot and is
not meant to replace the cutting-edge and in-depth explorative analysis and research
that makes use of CMIP output which will remain essential to close gaps in our
scientific understanding. Rather we suggest to make the well-established parts of ESM
evaluation that have demonstrated their value in the peer-reviewed literature more routine.
