### Liability for DLR´s own content

As far as DLR´s "own content" (information, software or documentation) is being
made available free of charge on this website [https://esmvaltool.org](https://esmvaltool.org),
any liability for defects as to quality or title of DLR´s own content- especially in
relation to the correctness or absence of defects or the absence of claims or
third party rights or in relation to completeness and/or fitness for purpose -
is excluded except in cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence.

### Liability for third party content via setting of hyperlinks

Cross-references or rather hyperlinks ("links") to content provided by other
content providers must be distinguished from DLR´s own content. By means of
hyperlinking DLR provides third-party content for use which is marked accordingly
by the indication "[external]" or by a link. Before setting the link DLR checks
this third-party content if it causes possible civil or criminal liability.
However, it cannot be excluded that the third-party content providers change
their content afterwards. DLR does not constantly check the third-party content
it refers to for changes made by the third-party content providers which could
engender DLR´s civil or criminal liability. If you believe that the linked
external sites violate applicable laws or otherwise have inappropriate content,
please let us know.
