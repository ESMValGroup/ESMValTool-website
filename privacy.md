are logged into your YouTube account, you enable YouTube to assign your surfing behaviour directly
to your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.

We use YouTube in extended data protection mode. According to YouTube, videos that are played in
extended data protection mode are not used to personalize browsing on YouTube. Ads that are played
in extended data protection mode are also not personalized. No cookies are set in extended data
protection mode. Instead, so-called local storage elements are stored in the user's browser, which
contain personal data similar to cookies and can be used for recognition. Details on the extended
data protection mode can be found here:
[https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780).
